### To do 

- [x] Classical One Dimensional Kicked rotor
- [x] Quantum 1D Kicked Rotor
- [x] Quantum 3D Kicked Rotor
- [ ] Understand Many-Body Localization in Quantum 3D Kicked rotor
- [ ] Understand Commutator Growth for Quantum 3D Kicked rotor

Notes to get acquainted with the classical kicked rotor and the quantum kicked rotor are present `pdf-notes`
